Title screen music by: Maarbble (Enchanting Grom Fright but it's electroswing)

ALPHA 0.1 Changes:
Added new menu/character selection screen music
Added new title screens
Added new textures for vanilla models (Dry Bones, Daisy, Peach, Rosalina) and all vanilla bikes for aforementioned characters
Changed the in-game names for the 4 edited characters
Changed character images for all 4 characters, including mini-map icons
Changed voices for Daisy and Peach to reflect Amity and Luz*

BUG LIST:
Changed music stops after one play; unsure as to why
Channel.szs file is unchangeable with BrawlBox, preventing some icons from changing
Interface glitches extremely bad when Custom Tracks enabled in CTGP-R (UNCLEAR IF JUST MY BAD INSTALL)
Interface inconsistencies between Dolphin Emulator and CTGP-R

Needs testing:
Wii U support in CTGP-R

*Currently figuring out how to upload the file to GitHub, my apologies, as it is approximately 100 Megabytes.
